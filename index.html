          <dd><strong>Key treatment: Deep relaxation.</strong>
          Swedish massage is one of the best-known and most common forms of massage available today. Its main therapeutic benefit is relaxation, working to help everyone from those suffering from everyday stress to more serious health conditions. So many things can be stressful in day-to-day life, leading to tense muscles that can be hard to relax. Swedish massage is the perfect treatment to relieve stress and dissolve away muscle tension.</dd>

          <dt><a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal">Deep Tissue Massage</a></dt>
          <dd><strong>Key treatment: Tension and pain relief, injury rehabilitation.</strong>
          Deep tissue massage varies greatly in technique and is ideal for a wide range of clients, from those who experience consistent pain, to people involved in heavy physical labor, or those who have sustained an injury, such as a repetitive strain injury. This type of massage focuses on the muscles located below the surface of the top muscles, using firm to deep pressure depending on a client’s needs. It is not uncommon for recipients of deep tissue massage to have a new muscle ache a day or two after a session, which is not permanent and is a sign that treatment has reached deep muscle and connective tissue. When receiving deep tissue work it is important for clients to communicate what they are feeling during a session, including any acute sensations of pain or tension.

          <dt><a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal">Trigger Point Therapy</a></dt>
          <dd><strong>Key treatment: Acute or chronic pain, headache relief, increased range of motion.</strong>
          A trigger point is a tight area within muscle tissue that causes pain in other parts of the body. A trigger point in the back, for example, may produce pain in the neck or head. Trigger point massage therapy is specifically designed to alleviate the source of the pain through cycles of isolated pressure and release. In this type of massage, recipients actively participate through deep breathing and identifying the exact location and intensity of discomfort. By releasing constricted areas of the muscles, pain is alleviated, resulting in a significant decrease in pain in as little as one treatment. Regular sessions of trigger point therapy can help naturally manage pain and stress from chronic injuries, including headaches, back pain, injury rehabilitation, and more. It can also be integrated with other massage techniques and is ideally paired with deep tissue massage.</dd>

          <dt><a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal">Prenatal Massage</a></dt>
          <dd><strong>Key treatment: Ease discomfort/stress associated with pregnancy.</strong>
          Prenatal massage carries the same goals of relaxation, pain relief, and increased circulation and mobility as other types of massage. Because of changes the body undergoes during pregnancy, special modification such as body pillows are used to ensure comfort for both the expecting mother and baby.
          This type of massage is also beneficial for postnatal women. Clients are welcomed and encouraged to bring the baby to the massage session. The baby can lay on the table, being comforted and cuddled while mom is receiving the benefits of massage. This is an excellent way for mom to bond with baby while receiving pampering and relaxation.

          <dd><strong>Key treatment: Relief of chronic or unresolved pain due to injury or illness.</strong>
          Fascia is a specialized system of connected tissue that lies below the skin which connects and stabilizes muscles and other tissue. Because fascia spreads from head to toe without interruption, people suffering from surgery, trauma, inflammation, or stress may experience fascial problems that result in pain or restricted mobility. Myofascial release is an effective therapeutic approach for the relief of cervical pain, back pain, fibromyalgia, scoliosis, neurological dysfunction, restricted range of motion, chronic pain, and headaches, in addition to other issues. This treatment is often integrated with other massage techniques to bring the widest array of benefits to clients.</dd>

          <dd><strong>Key treatment: Useful for many conditions, such as chronic back or neck pain, migraines, PTSD.</strong>
          CranioSacral Therapy (CST) is a gentle, hands-on approach that releases tensions deep in the body to relieve pain and improve whole-body health and performance. Few structures have as much influence over the body’s ability to function properly as the brain and spinal cord, and as such can benefit from targeted treatment. Using a soft touch, restrictions are released in the soft tissues that surround the central nervous system. CST is increasingly used as a preventive health measure for its ability to bolster resistance to disease, as well as its effectiveness for treating a wide range of medical problems associated with pain. This treatment is helpful for those with migraines, chronic neck or back pain, autism, motor coordination impairments, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, learning disabilities, ADD/ADHD, PTSD, and many other conditions.</dd>

          <dd><strong>Key treatment: Stress and pain management for athletes of all levels, chronic pain, injury rehabilitation.</strong>
          Sports massage focuses on increasing blood flow, reducing and eliminating pain, and increasing range of motion for clients with a wide range of athletic practice or those whose jobs demand physical activity. Sports massage assists in relieving muscular stress and preventing injuries, as well as rehabilitation from injury, even compensating for a lack of exercise during recovery. Areas of muscular stress can result from repetitive or stressful motion and are typically precursors to injury, but sports massage can accelerate the healing process, increase range of motion, reduce adhesions, and reduce swelling, bruising and pain. It is an ideal treatment for anyone with muscular stress, from those training for events, to clients with regular gym visits of varying intensities. Most often, a combination of treatment types are used during each session.</dd>
